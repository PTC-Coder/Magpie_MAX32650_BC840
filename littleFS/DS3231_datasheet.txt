Extremely Accurate I2C-Integrated
RTC/TCXO/Crystal

DS3231

General Description

The DS3231 is a low-cost, extremely accurate I2C

real-time clock (RTC) with an integrated temperaturecompensated crystal oscillator (TCXO) and crystal.
The device incorporates a battery input, and maintains
accurate timekeeping when main power to the device
is interrupted. The integration of the crystal resonator
enhances the long-term accuracy of the device as well
as reduces the piece-part count in a manufacturing line.
The DS3231 is available in commercial and industrial
temperature ranges, and is offered in a 16-pin, 300-mil
SO package.
The RTC maintains seconds, minutes, hours, day, date,
month, and year information. The date at the end of the
month is automatically adjusted for months with fewer
than 31 days, including corrections for leap year. The
clock operates in either the 24-hour or 12-hour format
with an AM/PM indicator. Two programmable time-of-day
alarms and a programmable square-wave output are
provided. Address and data are transferred serially
through an I2C bidirectional bus.
A precision temperature-compensated voltage reference
and comparator circuit monitors the status of VCC to
detect power failures, to provide a reset output, and to
automatically switch to the backup supply when necessary.
Additionally, the RST pin is monitored as a pushbutton
input for generating a μP reset.

WARNING: Negative undershoots below -0.3V while the part is in battery-backed mode may cause loss of data.
Note 2: Limits at -40°C are guaranteed by design and not production tested.
Note 3: All voltages are referenced to ground.
Note 4: ICCA—SCL clocking at max frequency = 400kHz.
Note 5: Current is the averaged input current, which includes the temperature conversion current.
Note 6: The RST pin has an internal 50kΩ (nominal) pullup resistor to VCC.
Note 7: After this period, the first clock pulse is generated.
Note 8: A device must internally provide a hold time of at least 300ns for the SDA signal (referred to the VIH(MIN) of the SCL signal) to bridge the undefined region of the falling edge of SCL.
Note 9: The maximum tHD:DAT needs only to be met if the device does not stretch the low period (tLOW) of the SCL signal.
Note 10: A fast-mode device can be used in a standard-mode system, but the requirement tSU:DAT ≥ 250ns must then be met. This
is automatically the case if the device does not stretch the low period of the SCL signal. If such a device does stretch the
low period of the SCL signal, it must output the next data bit to the SDA line tR(MAX) + tSU:DAT = 1000 + 250 = 1250ns
before the SCL line is released.
Note 11: CB—total capacitance of one bus line in pF.
Note 12: The parameter tOSF is the period of time the oscillator must be stopped for the OSF flag to be set over the voltage range
of 0.0V ≤ VCC ≤ VCC(MAX) and 2.3V ≤ VBAT ≤ 3.4V.
Note 13: This delay applies only if the oscillator is enabled and running. If the EOSC bit is a 1, tREC is bypassed and RST immediately goes high. The state of RST does not affect the I2C interface, RTC, or TCXO.

FUNCTION
32kHz Output. This open-drain pin requires an external pullup resistor. When enabled, the output operates on
either power supply. It may be left open if not used.
DC Power Pin for Primary Power Supply. This pin should be decoupled using a 0.1µF to 1.0µF capacitor.
If not used, connect to ground.

Active-Low Interrupt or Square-Wave Output. This open-drain pin requires an external pullup resistor connected
to a supply at 5.5V or less. This multifunction pin is determined by the state of the INTCN bit in the Control
Register (0Eh). When INTCN is set to logic 0, this pin outputs a square wave and its frequency is determined by
INT/SQW RS2 and RS1 bits. When INTCN is set to logic 1, then a match between the timekeeping registers and either of
the alarm registers activates the INT/SQW pin (if the alarm is enabled). Because the INTCN bit is set to logic 1
when power is first applied, the pin defaults to an interrupt output with alarms disabled. The pullup voltage can
be up to 5.5V, regardless of the voltage on VCC. If not used, this pin can be left unconnected.

RST

Active-Low Reset. This pin is an open-drain input/output. It indicates the status of VCC relative to the
VPF specification. As VCC falls below VPF, the RST pin is driven low. When VCC exceeds VPF, for tRST, the
RST pin is pulled high by the internal pullup resistor. The active-low, open-drain output is combined with a
debounced pushbutton input function. This pin can be activated by a pushbutton reset request. It has an internal
50kΩ nominal value pullup resistor to VCC. No external pullup resistors should be connected. If the oscillator is
disabled, tREC is bypassed and RST immediately goes high.

VBAT

Backup Power-Supply Input. When using the device with the VBAT input as the primary power source, this pin
should be decoupled using a 0.1µF to 1.0µF low-leakage capacitor. When using the device with the VBAT input
as the backup power source, the capacitor is not required. If VBAT is not used, connect to ground. The device is
UL recognized to ensure against reverse charging when used with a primary lithium battery.

SDA

Serial Data Input/Output. This pin is the data input/output for the I2C serial interface. This open-drain pin
requires an external pullup resistor. The pullup voltage can be up to 5.5V, regardless of the voltage on VCC.

SCL

Serial Clock Input. This pin is the clock input for the I2C serial interface and is used to synchronize data
movement on the serial interface. Up to 5.5V can be used for this pin, regardless of the voltage on VCC.

Detailed Description

The DS3231 is a serial RTC driven by a temperaturecompensated 32kHz crystal oscillator. The TCXO provides
a stable and accurate reference clock, and maintains the
RTC to within ±2 minutes per year accuracy from -40°C
to +85°C. The TCXO frequency output is available at the
32kHz pin. The RTC is a low-power clock/calendar with
two programmable time-of-day alarms and a programmable square-wave output. The INT/SQW provides either an
interrupt signal due to alarm conditions or a square-wave
output. The clock/calendar provides seconds, minutes,
hours, day, date, month, and year information. The date at
the end of the month is automatically adjusted for months
with fewer than 31 days, including corrections for leap

www.maximintegrated.com

year. The clock operates in either the 24-hour or 12-hour
format with an AM/PM indicator. The internal registers are
accessible though an I2C bus interface.
A temperature-compensated voltage reference and comparator circuit monitors the level of VCC to detect power failures and to automatically switch to the backup supply when
necessary. The RST pin provides an external pushbutton
function and acts as an indicator of a power-fail event.

Operation

The block diagram shows the main elements of the
DS3231. The eight blocks can be grouped into four functional groups: TCXO, power control, pushbutton function,
and RTC. Their operations are described separately in the
following sections.

Maxim Integrated │ 9

Extremely Accurate I2C-Integrated
RTC/TCXO/Crystal

DS3231

32kHz TCXO

The temperature sensor, oscillator, and control logic form
the TCXO. The controller reads the output of the on-chip
temperature sensor and uses a lookup table to determine
the capacitance required, adds the aging correction in
AGE register, and then sets the capacitance selection registers. New values, including changes to the AGE register,
are loaded only when a change in the temperature value
occurs, or when a user-initiated temperature conversion
is completed. Temperature conversion occurs on initial
application of VCC and once every 64 seconds afterwards.

Power Control

This function is provided by a temperature-compensated
voltage reference and a comparator circuit that monitors
the VCC level. When VCC is greater than VPF, the part is
powered by VCC. When VCC is less than VPF but greater
than VBAT, the DS3231 is powered by VCC. If VCC is less
than VPF and is less than VBAT, the device is powered by
VBAT. See Table 1.

Table 1. Power Control
SUPPLY CONDITION

ACTIVE SUPPLY

VCC < VPF, VCC < VBAT

VBAT

VCC < VPF, VCC > VBAT

VCC

VCC > VPF, VCC < VBAT

VCC

VCC > VPF, VCC > VBAT

VCC

To preserve the battery, the first time VBAT is applied
to the device, the oscillator will not start up until VCC
exceeds VPF, or until a valid I2C address is written to
the part. Typical oscillator startup time is less than one
second. Approximately 2 seconds after VCC is applied,
or a valid I2C address is written, the device makes a
temperature measurement and applies the calculated
correction to the oscillator. Once the oscillator is running,
it continues to run as long as a valid power source is available (VCC or VBAT), and the device continues to measure
the temperature and correct the oscillator frequency every
64 seconds.
On the first application of power (VCC) or when a valid I2C
address is written to the part (VBAT), the time and date
registers are reset to 01/01/00 01 00:00:00 (DD/MM/YY
DOW HH:MM:SS).

VBAT Operation

There are several modes of operation that affect the
amount of VBAT current that is drawn. While the device

www.maximintegrated.com

is powered by VBAT and the serial interface is active,
active battery current, IBATA, is drawn. When the serial interface is inactive, timekeeping current (IBATT),
which includes the averaged temperature conversion
current, IBATTC, is used (refer to Application Note 3644:
Power Considerations for Accurate Real-Time Clocks
for details). Temperature conversion current, IBATTC, is
specified since the system must be able to support the
periodic higher current pulse and still maintain a valid voltage level. Data retention current, IBATTDR, is the current
drawn by the part when the oscillator is stopped (EOSC
= 1). This mode can be used to minimize battery requirements for times when maintaining time and date information is not necessary, e.g., while the end system is waiting
to be shipped to a customer.

Pushbutton Reset Function

The DS3231 provides for a pushbutton switch to be connected to the RST output pin. When the DS3231 is not in
a reset cycle, it continuously monitors the RST signal for
a low going edge. If an edge transition is detected, the
DS3231 debounces the switch by pulling the RST low.
After the internal timer has expired (PBDB), the DS3231
continues to monitor the RST line. If the line is still low,
the DS3231 continuously monitors the line looking for a
rising edge. Upon detecting release, the DS3231 forces
the RST pin low and holds it low for tRST.
RST is also used to indicate a power-fail condition. When
VCC is lower than VPF, an internal power-fail signal is
generated, which forces the RST pin low. When VCC
returns to a level above VPF, the RST pin is held low for
approximately 250ms (tREC) to allow the power supply
to stabilize. If the oscillator is not running (see the Power
Control section) when VCC is applied, tREC is bypassed
and RST immediately goes high. Assertion of the RST
output, whether by pushbutton or power-fail detection,
does not affect the internal operation of the DS3231.

Real-Time Clock

With the clock source from the TCXO, the RTC provides
seconds, minutes, hours, day, date, month, and year
information. The date at the end of the month is automatically adjusted for months with fewer than 31 days, including corrections for leap year. The clock operates in either
the 24-hour or 12-hour format with an AM/PM indicator.
The clock provides two programmable time-of-day alarms
and a programmable square-wave output. The INT/SQW
pin either generates an interrupt due to alarm condition
or outputs a square-wave signal and the selection is controlled by the bit INTCN.

Figure 1. Timekeeping Registers
Note: Unless otherwise specified, the registers’ state is not defined when power is first applied.

Address Map

Figure 1 shows the address map for the DS3231 timekeeping registers. During a multibyte access, when the
address pointer reaches the end of the register space
(12h), it wraps around to location 00h. On an I2C START
or address pointer incrementing to location 00h, the current time is transferred to a second set of registers. The
time information is read from these secondary registers,
while the clock may continue to run. This eliminates the
need to reread the registers in case the main registers
update during a read.

I2C

Interface

The I2C interface is accessible whenever either VCC or
VBAT is at a valid level. If a microcontroller connected

www.maximintegrated.com

to the DS3231 resets because of a loss of VCC or other
event, it is possible that the microcontroller and DS3231
I2C communications could become unsynchronized, e.g.,
the microcontroller resets while reading data from the
DS3231. When the microcontroller resets, the DS3231
I2C interface may be placed into a known state by toggling SCL until SDA is observed to be at a high level. At
that point the microcontroller should pull SDA low while
SCL is high, generating a START condition.

Clock and Calendar

The time and calendar information is obtained by reading
the appropriate register bytes. Figure 1 illustrates the RTC
registers. The time and calendar data are set or initialized
by writing the appropriate register bytes. The contents of
the time and calendar registers are in the binary-coded

DS3231

Alarms

decimal (BCD) format. The DS3231 can be run in either
12-hour or 24-hour mode. Bit 6 of the hours register is
defined as the 12- or 24-hour mode select bit. When high,
the 12-hour mode is selected. In the 12-hour mode, bit 5
is the AM/PM bit with logic-high being PM. In the 24-hour
mode, bit 5 is the 20-hour bit (20–23 hours). The century
bit (bit 7 of the month register) is toggled when the years
register overflows from 99 to 00.

The DS3231 contains two time-of-day/date alarms.
Alarm 1 can be set by writing to registers 07h to 0Ah.
Alarm 2 can be set by writing to registers 0Bh to 0Dh.
The alarms can be programmed (by the alarm enable
and INTCN bits of the control register) to activate the
INT/SQW output on an alarm match condition. Bit 7 of
each of the time-of-day/date alarm registers are mask
bits (Table 2). When all the mask bits for each alarm
are logic 0, an alarm only occurs when the values in
the timekeeping registers match the corresponding values stored in the time-of-day/date alarm registers. The
alarms can also be programmed to repeat every second,
minute, hour, day, or date. Table 2 shows the possible
settings. Configurations not listed in the table will result
in illogical operation.

The day-of-week register increments at midnight. Values
that correspond to the day of week are user-defined but
must be sequential (i.e., if 1 equals Sunday, then 2 equals
Monday, and so on). Illogical time and date entries result
in undefined operation.
When reading or writing the time and date registers, secondary (user) buffers are used to prevent errors when the
internal registers update. When reading the time and date
registers, the user buffers are synchronized to the internal
registers on any START and when the register pointer
rolls over to zero. The time information is read from these
secondary registers, while the clock continues to run. This
eliminates the need to reread the registers in case the
main registers update during a read.

The DY/DT bits (bit 6 of the alarm day/date registers)
control whether the alarm value stored in bits 0 to 5 of
that register reflects the day of the week or the date of
the month. If DY/DT is written to logic 0, the alarm will be
the result of a match with date of the month. If DY/DT is
written to logic 1, the alarm will be the result of a match
with day of the week.

The countdown chain is reset whenever the seconds
register is written. Write transfers occur on the acknowledge from the DS3231. Once the countdown chain is
reset, to avoid rollover issues the remaining time and
date registers must be written within 1 second. The 1Hz
square-wave output, if enabled, transitions high 500ms
after the seconds data transfer, provided the oscillator is
already running.

When the RTC register values match alarm register settings, the corresponding Alarm Flag ‘A1F’ or ‘A2F’ bit is
set to logic 1. If the corresponding Alarm Interrupt Enable
‘A1IE’ or ‘A2IE’ is also set to logic 1 and the INTCN bit
is set to logic 1, the alarm condition will activate the
INT/SQW signal. The match is tested on the once-persecond update of the time and date registers.

Special-Purpose Registers

The DS3231 has two additional registers (control and status) that control the real-time clock, alarms, and squarewave output.

the square wave has been enabled. The following table
shows the square-wave frequencies that can be selected
with the RS bits. These bits are both set to logic 1
(8.192kHz) when power is first applied.

Control Register (0Eh)

SQUARE-WAVE OUTPUT FREQUENCY

Bit 7: Enable Oscillator (EOSC). When set to logic 0,
the oscillator is started. When set to logic 1, the oscillator
is stopped when the DS3231 switches to VBAT. This bit
is clear (logic 0) when power is first applied. When the
DS3231 is powered by VCC, the oscillator is always on
regardless of the status of the EOSC bit. When EOSC is
disabled, all register data is static.
Bit 6: Battery-Backed Square-Wave Enable (BBSQW).
When set to logic 1 with INTCN = 0 and VCC < VPF, this
bit enables the square wave. When BBSQW is logic 0,
the INT/SQW pin goes high impedance when VCC < VPF.
This bit is disabled (logic 0) when power is first applied.
Bit 5: Convert Temperature (CONV). Setting this bit to
1 forces the temperature sensor to convert the temperature into digital code and execute the TCXO algorithm to
update the capacitance array to the oscillator. This can
only happen when a conversion is not already in progress. The user should check the status bit BSY before
forcing the controller to start a new TCXO execution. A
user-initiated temperature conversion does not affect the
internal 64-second update cycle.
A user-initiated temperature conversion does not affect
the BSY bit for approximately 2ms. The CONV bit remains
at a 1 from the time it is written until the conversion is
finished, at which time both CONV and BSY go to 0. The
CONV bit should be used when monitoring the status of a
user-initiated conversion.
Bits 4 and 3: Rate Select (RS2 and RS1). These bits
control the frequency of the square-wave output when

Bit 2: Interrupt Control (INTCN). This bit controls the
INT/SQW signal. When the INTCN bit is set to logic 0,
a square wave is output on the INT/SQW pin. When the
INTCN bit is set to logic 1, then a match between the timekeeping registers and either of the alarm registers activates the INT/SQW output (if the alarm is also enabled).
The corresponding alarm flag is always set regardless of
the state of the INTCN bit. The INTCN bit is set to logic 1
when power is first applied.
Bit 1: Alarm 2 Interrupt Enable (A2IE). When set to
logic 1, this bit permits the alarm 2 flag (A2F) bit in the
status register to assert INT/SQW (when INTCN = 1).
When the A2IE bit is set to logic 0 or INTCN is set to logic
0, the A2F bit does not initiate an interrupt signal. The
A2IE bit is disabled (logic 0) when power is first applied.
Bit 0: Alarm 1 Interrupt Enable (A1IE). When set to
logic 1, this bit permits the alarm 1 flag (A1F) bit in the
status register to assert INT/SQW (when INTCN = 1).
When the A1IE bit is set to logic 0 or INTCN is set to logic
0, the A1F bit does not initiate the INT/SQW signal. The
A1IE bit is disabled (logic 0) when power is first applied.

A1IE bit is logic 1 and the INTCN bit is set to logic 1, the
INT/SQW pin is also asserted. A1F is cleared when written
to logic 0. This bit can only be written to logic 0. Attempting
to write to logic 1 leaves the value unchanged.

Bit 7: Oscillator Stop Flag (OSF). A logic 1 in this bit indicates that the oscillator either is stopped or was stopped
for some period and may be used to judge the validity of
the timekeeping data. This bit is set to logic 1 any time
that the oscillator stops. The following are examples of
conditions that can cause the OSF bit to be set:

Aging Offset

The aging offset register takes a user-provided value to
add to or subtract from the codes in the capacitance array
registers. The code is encoded in two’s complement, with
bit 7 representing the sign bit. One LSB represents one
small capacitor to be switched in or out of the capacitance
array at the crystal pins. The aging offset register capacitance value is added or subtracted from the capacitance
value that the device calculates for each temperature
compensation. The offset register is added to the capacitance array during a normal temperature conversion, if
the temperature changes from the previous conversion, or
during a manual user conversion (setting the CONV bit).
To see the effects of the aging register on the 32kHz output frequency immediately, a manual conversion should
be started after each aging register change.

1) The first time power is applied.
2) The voltages present on both VCC and VBAT are insufficient to support oscillation.
3) The EOSC bit is turned off in battery-backed mode.
4) External influences on the crystal (i.e., noise, leakage,
etc.).
This bit remains at logic 1 until written to logic 0.
Bit 3: Enable 32kHz Output (EN32kHz). This bit controls the status of the 32kHz pin. When set to logic 1, the
32kHz pin is enabled and outputs a 32.768kHz squarewave signal. When set to logic 0, the 32kHz pin goes to a
high-impedance state. The initial power-up state of this bit
is logic 1, and a 32.768kHz square-wave signal appears
at the 32kHz pin after a power source is applied to the
DS3231 (if the oscillator is running).

Positive aging values add capacitance to the array, slowing the oscillator frequency. Negative values remove
capacitance from the array, increasing the oscillator
frequency.

Bit 2: Busy (BSY). This bit indicates the device is busy
executing TCXO functions. It goes to logic 1 when the conversion signal to the temperature sensor is asserted and
then is cleared when the device is in the 1-minute idle state.

The change in ppm per LSB is different at different temperatures. The frequency vs. temperature curve is shifted
by the values used in this register. At +25°C, one LSB
typically provides about 0.1ppm change in frequency.

Bit 1: Alarm 2 Flag (A2F). A logic 1 in the alarm 2 flag bit
indicates that the time matched the alarm 2 registers. If the
A2IE bit is logic 1 and the INTCN bit is set to logic 1, the
INT/SQW pin is also asserted. A2F is cleared when written
to logic 0. This bit can only be written to logic 0. Attempting
to write to logic 1 leaves the value unchanged.

Use of the aging register is not needed to achieve the
accuracy as defined in the EC tables, but could be used
to help compensate for aging at a given temperature.
See the Typical Operating Characteristics section for a
graph showing the effect of the register on accuracy over
temperature.

Bit 0: Alarm 1 Flag (A1F). A logic 1 in the alarm 1 flag bit
indicates that the time matched the alarm 1 registers. If the

Temperature Registers (11h–12h)

Temperature is represented as a 10-bit code with a
resolution of 0.25°C and is accessible at location 11h and
12h. The temperature is encoded in two’s complement
format. The upper 8 bits, the integer portion, are at location 11h and the lower 2 bits, the fractional portion, are in
the upper nibble at location 12h. For example, 00011001
01b = +25.25°C. Upon power reset, the registers are set
to a default temperature of 0°C and the controller starts
a temperature conversion. The temperature is read on
initial application of VCC or I2C access on VBAT and once
every 64 seconds afterwards. The temperature registers
are updated after each user-initiated conversion and on
every 64-second conversion. The temperature registers
are read-only.

I2C Serial Data Bus

The DS3231 supports a bidirectional I2C bus and data
transmission protocol. A device that sends data onto the
bus is defined as a transmitter and a device receiving data
is defined as a receiver. The device that controls the message is called a master. The devices that are controlled
by the master are slaves. The bus must be controlled by
a master device that generates the serial clock (SCL),
controls the bus access, and generates the START and
STOP conditions. The DS3231 operates as a slave on the
I2C bus. Connections to the bus are made through the
SCL input and open-drain SDA I/O lines. Within the bus
specifications, a standard mode (100kHz maximum clock
rate) and a fast mode (400kHz maximum clock rate) are
defined. The DS3231 works in both modes.
The following bus protocol has been defined (Figure 2):
● Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not
busy.
● During data transfer, the data line must remain stable
whenever the clock line is high. Changes in the data

www.maximintegrated.com

line while the clock line is high are interpreted as control signals.
Accordingly, the following bus conditions have been
defined:
Bus not busy: Both data and clock lines remain high.
START data transfer: A change in the state of the
data line from high to low, while the clock line is high,
defines a START condition.
STOP data transfer: A change in the state of the
data line from low to high, while the clock line is high,
defines a STOP condition.
Data valid: The state of the data line represents valid
data when, after a START condition, the data line is
stable for the duration of the high period of the clock
signal. The data on the line must be changed during
the low period of the clock signal. There is one clock
pulse per bit of data.
Each data transfer is initiated with a START condition
and terminated with a STOP condition. The number
of data bytes transferred between the START and the
STOP conditions is not limited, and is determined by
the master device. The information is transferred bytewise and each receiver acknowledges with a ninth bit.
Acknowledge: Each receiving device, when
addressed, is obliged to generate an acknowledge
after the reception of each byte. The master device
must generate an extra clock pulse, which is associated with this acknowledge bit.
A device that acknowledges must pull down the SDA
line during the acknowledge clock pulse in such a way
that the SDA line is stable low during the high period of
the acknowledge-related clock pulse. Of course, setup
and hold times must be taken into account. A master
must signal an end of data to the slave by not generat-

received byte. Data is transferred with the most significant bit (MSB) first.

Figures 3 and 4 detail how data transfer is accomplished
on the I2C bus. Depending upon the state of the R/W bit,
two types of data transfer are possible:

Data transfer from a slave transmitter to a master
receiver. The first byte (the slave address) is transmitted by the master. The slave then returns an acknowledge bit. Next follows a number of data bytes transmitted by the slave to the master. The master returns an
acknowledge bit after all received bytes other than the

last byte. At the end of the last received byte, a not
acknowledge is returned.
The master device generates all the serial clock pulses
and the START and STOP conditions. A transfer
is ended with a STOP condition or with a repeated
START condition. Since a repeated START condition
is also the beginning of the next serial transfer, the bus
will not be released. Data is transferred with the most
significant bit (MSB) first.
The DS3231 can operate in the following two modes:
Slave receiver mode (DS3231 write mode): Serial
data and clock are received through SDA and SCL.
After each byte is received, an acknowledge bit is
transmitted. START and STOP conditions are recognized as the beginning and end of a serial transfer.
Address recognition is performed by hardware after
reception of the slave address and direction bit. The
slave address byte is the first byte received after the
master generates the START condition. The slave
address byte contains the 7-bit DS3231 address,
which is 1101000, followed by the direction bit (R/W),
which is 0 for a write. After receiving and decoding the
slave address byte, the DS3231 outputs an acknowledge on SDA. After the DS3231 acknowledges the
slave address + write bit, the master transmits a word
address to the DS3231. This sets the register pointer
on the DS3231, with the DS3231 acknowledging the

www.maximintegrated.com

transfer. The master may then transmit zero or more
bytes of data, with the DS3231 acknowledging each
byte received. The register pointer increments after
each data byte is transferred. The master generates a
STOP condition to terminate the data write.
Slave transmitter mode (DS3231 read mode): The
first byte is received and handled as in the slave
receiver mode. However, in this mode, the direction
bit indicates that the transfer direction is reversed.
Serial data is transmitted on SDA by the DS3231 while
the serial clock is input on SCL. START and STOP
conditions are recognized as the beginning and end
of a serial transfer. Address recognition is performed
by hardware after reception of the slave address and
direction bit. The slave address byte is the first byte
received after the master generates a START condition. The slave address byte contains the 7-bit DS3231
address, which is 1101000, followed by the direction
bit (R/W), which is 1 for a read. After receiving and
decoding the slave address byte, the DS3231 outputs
an acknowledge on SDA. The DS3231 then begins to
transmit data starting with the register address pointed
to by the register pointer. If the register pointer is not
written to before the initiation of a read mode, the first
address that is read is the last one stored in the register pointer. The DS3231 must receive a not acknowledge to end a read.
